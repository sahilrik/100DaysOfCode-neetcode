LEETCODE 167 SUMTWO 2 SORTED

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Explanation:

two pointers starting from the two extreams of the array 


while(nums[l] + nums[r] != target){
    if(nums[l] + nums[r] < target){
        l--                       // l-- because since sorted r is already at the largets digit and to reach a greater numeric value we need to increase l.
    }else{
        r--
    }
}
